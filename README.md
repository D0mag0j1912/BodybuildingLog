## Main features
  - Log new training
  - View past trainings
  - Create custom training splits

### Log new training
This is the core feature of the application because it allows users to record and document their workouts.
Users can input details about their training session. This typically includes user's bodyweight, date of the workout, exercises performed and sets performed.
Users can log individual exercises they performed during the workout. This includes specifying the exercise name, the number of sets and reps and the weight or resistance used.
Additionally, users have these new training features at their disposal:
  - Reorder exercise order
  - Delete specific exercise
  - Change exercise set category
